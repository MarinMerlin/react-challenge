# React Challenge: Recommendation carousel

To setup, have npm installed and run :

    npm install

Thats it! Now you can run it with:

    npm start

You can launch a very basic test suite (just test if the app component renders correctly) with:

    npm test

## Comments:

I spent a lot of time trying to make my own carousel like asked but having no prior experience in animation with react and css
i realised i would not finish on time and preffered to use the reactstrap carousel component.
